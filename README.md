# Pairoulette

This project will be a place to find and offer pair programming sessions.

The idea is quite easy to understand. First screen let you choose if you want
to find or offer a session.

_Disclaimer: This is a toy project to discover the Lotus web framework. It's
highly based on the joshoda/reeder project that has been used at a Lotus
workshop._

## Offer

want:

* your email,
* the expected duration,
* a brief summary of the task that could be done,
* the language that can be spoken and
* any other useful comments (tools, prerequisites, etc).

When an offer is submited, its author will receive an email with a link to the
monitoring interface of this offer.

A review of the offers should condition its publication.

The offers die after 7 days of publication but can be re-published via the
monitoring interface.

### Monitoring

In this interface you can see informations about your offer:

You can also make some actions:

## Find

The finding interface consists in a list that can be filtered. If you want to
get in touch with its owner then send him your email or your twitter account,
he will be notified that you are interested and get back to you.
